<p>Thank you for taking part in our study today. As noted at the start of the experiment, you will be paid {{session.config.participation_fee}} for your participation.</p>

<p>There was also the possibility of earning a bonus of another {{session.config.bonus_payment}}£.</p>

<p>You scored {{participant.total_score}} which means you had a {{participant.chance_to_win}}% chance of receiving the bonus payment.</p>

<p>Your lottery number was {{participant.random_lottery_number}}.</p>
{{ if participant.win_bonus }}
  Hence, you earned the lottery ticket! It entitles you to the extra {{session.config.bonus_payment}}£. <br>
{{ else }}
  Unfortunately, you did not win the lottery bonus because your score-based number, {{participant.chance_to_win}}, was smaller than the lottery number. 
{{ endif }}

<p>Therefore your total payment for today is <strong>{{participant.payoff_plus_participation_fee}}.</strong></p>
