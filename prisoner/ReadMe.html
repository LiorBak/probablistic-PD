<h2>
    ToDo
</h2>

#UX inhencements:
#instructions: paired 10 rounds + how payment will work + ask players not to close experiment window
#Before new supergame start: screen
#end screen: thanks + payment function
#update instructions in the introduction according to the desicion page. 
#++ look at Peters shared file.

#handle drpoputs (wait for next supergame + special screen 'your opponent dropped')
V #timer + random choice & penalty

<h2>
    Handle Dropouts
</h2>
1) When a player closes his window he will never be marked as a droupout, because time limitations will not apply to him. To solve this, get to his link and manualy progress him. You can see his participant 'is_dropout' value = true

<h2>
    Run the game
</h2>
1) Change the constunt C.IS_TEST to False
1.2) fix timeout functions in Desicion and Results (rmove first line)
1.3) fix introduction is.displayed (=if player.round_number == 1)
2) number of rounds - control via C.ROUNDS_PER_SUPERGAME
3) number of players - change 2 things: (a) number of players in the session config (b) group_matrices function in the Subsession module. Youll have to change this one manualy, and write a matrix of pairs that suits the number of players. 
4) grouping - read 3) (b) above.
5) game type - set player.game_type to one of the following: PD, CG, pCG, pPD.
