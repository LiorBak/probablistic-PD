#handle drpoputs (wait for next supergame + special screen 'your opponent dropped')

<h2>
    Handle Dropouts
</h2>
1) When a player closes his window he will never be marked as a droupout, because time limitations will not apply to him. To solve this, get to his link and manualy progress him. You can see his participant 'is_dropout' value = true

<h2>
    Run the game
</h2>
1) Change the constunt C.IS_TEST to False
1.2) fix timeout functions in Desicion and Results (rmove first line) - done
1.3) fix introduction is.displayed (=if player.round_number == 1) - done
2) number of rounds - control via C.ROUNDS_PER_SUPERGAME. set to 50
3) number of players - change 2 things: (a) number of players in the session config (b) group_matrices function in the Subsession module. Youll have to change this one manualy, and write a matrix of pairs that suits the number of players. 
4) grouping - read 3) (b) above.
5) game type - set player.game_type to one of the following: PD, CG, pCG, pPD.
